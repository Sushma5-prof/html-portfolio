<h3>Tale of the Nine-Tailed</h3>
<p>
    This is one my favorite k-drama. It is fantasy genre k-drama. The storyline and the characters,<br>
    their acting were so good but a bit of a sad ending which made me a bit angry.

    and The Character have done a great job at acting and in making the viewers feel happy, emotional, entertained and many more.
